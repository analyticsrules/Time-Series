TIME-SERIES DATA & CROSS SECTIONAL DATA
Time-Seris Data:- Set of observations collected at usually discrete and equally spaced time intervals. For e.g daily closing
stock price of a certain company for last 6 months.
Cross-Sectional Data:- Observations coming from different individuals or groups at a single point of time. For e.g. closing
stock prices of 20 different tech companies on 15th Nov 2015. Here underlying population should consists members with
similar characteristics.

An observed time series can be decomposed into three components: the trend (long term direction), the seasonal 
(systematic, calendar related movements) and the irregular (unsystematic, short term fluctuations).

Time series can be classified into two different types: STOCK and FLOW. 
A stock series is a measure of certain attributes at a point in time and can be thought of as “stocktakes”. For example, the 
Monthly Labour Force Survey is a stock measure because it takes stock of whether a person was employed in the reference week. 

Flow series are series which are a measure of activity over a given period. For example, surveys of Retail Trade activity. 
Manufacturing is also a flow measure because a certain amount is produced each day, and then these amounts are summed to give 
a total value for production for a given reporting period.
The main difference between a stock and a flow series is that flow series can contain effects related to the calendar 
(trading day effects). Both types of series can still be seasonally adjusted using the same seasonal adjustment process.

SEASONAL EFFECT:- A seasonal effect is a systematic and calendar related effect. For. e.g. Trading day (consumption of many items
is highest on weekends). High consumption on Moving days (Easter day or Eid, date is not fixed)

WHAT IS SEASONAL ADJUSTMENT AND WHY DO WE NEED IT?
Seasonal adjustment is the process of estimating and then removing from a time series influences that are systematic and calendar
related. Observed data needs to be seasonally adjusted as seasonal effects can conceal both the true underlying movement in the 
series, as well as certain non-seasonal characteristics which may be of interest to analysts.


WHY CAN'T WE JUST COMPARE ORIGINAL DATA FROM THE SAME PERIOD IN EACH YEAR?
A comparison of original data from the same period in each year does not completely remove all seasonal effects. Certain holidays
such as Easter and Chinese New Year fall in different periods in each year, hence they will distort observations. Also, year 
to year values will be biased by any changes in seasonal patterns that occur over time.

WHEN IS SEASONAL ADJUSTMENT INAPPROPRIATE?
When a time series is dominated by the trend or irregular components, it is nearly impossible to identify and remove what little 
seasonality is present. Hence seasonally adjusting a non-seasonal series is impractical and will often introduce an artificial 
seasonal element.


WHAT IS SEASONALITY?
A seasonal pattern occurs when a time series is affected by seasonal factors such as the time of the year or the day of the week.
It is related to influences such as:
A) Natural Conditions:- weather fluctuations that are representative of the season 
B) Business and Administrative procedures:-start and end of the school term
C) Trading day effects:- Sales are generally higher on weekends
D) Moving Holiday Effects:- Easter Day, Eid, Bakried (date not fixed of these holidays)

HOW DO WE IDENTIFY SEASONALITY?
Seasonality in a time series can be identified by regularly spaced peaks and troughs which have a consistent direction and 
approximately the same magnitude every year, relative to the trend.

WHAT IS AN IRREGULAR (or Cycle)?
The irregular component (sometimes also known as the residual) is what remains after the seasonal and trend components of a time
series have been estimated and removed. It results from short term fluctuations in the series which are neither systematic nor
predictable.

WHAT IS THE TREND?
A trend exists when there is a long-term increase or decrease in the data. 


WHAT ARE THE UNDERLYING MODELS USED TO DECOMPOSE THE OBSERVED TIME SERIES?
Decomposition models are typically additive or multiplicative, but can also take other forms such as pseudo-additive.

   ***ADDITIVE DECOMPOSITION***
In some time series, the amplitude of both the seasonal and irregular variations do not change as the level of the trend rises
or falls. In such cases, an additive model is appropriate.In the additive model, the observed time series (Ot) is considered 
to be the sum of three independent components: the seasonal St, the trend Tt and the irregular.
It. 
                 Observed Series = Trend + Seasonal + Irregular
                 Qt = Tt+St+It   where t denotes time series
              thus, Seasonally Adjusted Series = Observed Series-Seasonal = Trend+Irregular



   ***MULTIPLICATIVE DECOMPOSITION***
In many time series, the amplitude of both the seasonal and irregular variations increase as the level of the trend rises.
In this situation, a multiplicative model is usually appropriate. In the multiplicative model, the original time series is 
expressed as the product of trend, seasonal and irregular components.
                   Observed Series = Trend X Seasonal X Irregulat = Tt*St*It
                   Seasonally Adjusted Series = Observed ÷ Seasonal = Trend X Irregular
                   
                   
    ***PSEUDO-ADDITIVE DECOMPOSITION***
The multiplicative model cannot be used when the original time series contains very small or zero values. This is because it 
is not possible to divide a number by zero. In these cases, a pseudo additive model combining the elements of both the additive
and multiplicative models is used. This model assumes that seasonal and irregular variations are both dependent on the level of
the trend but independent of each other. 
                  Observed/Original Series = trend X (Seasonal + Irregular -1) = T*(S+I-1)
                  Seasonally Adjusted Estimate  = observed - trend(Seasonal -1) =  O - T X (S-1)
                  

HOW DO I KNOW WHICH DECOMPOSITION MODEL TO USE?
To choose an appropriate decomposition model, the time series analyst will examine a graph of the original series and try a 
range of models, selecting the one which yields the most stable seasonal component. If the magnitude of the seasonal component
is relatively constant regardless of changes in the trend, an additive model is suitable. If it varies with changes in the 
trend, a multiplicative model is the most likely candidate. However if the series contains values close or equal to zero, and
the magnitude of seasonal component appears to be dependent upon the trend level, then pseudo-additive model is most appropriate.


WHAT IS LAG?
So LAG=x is basically seeing how correlated Time T is with time T-x

WHAT IS AUTOCORRELATION & CORRLOGRAM?
autocorrelation measures the linear relationship between lagged values of a time series. For example, r1 measures the 
relationship between yt and yt−1, r2 measures the relationship between yt and yt−2, and so on. The autocorrelation coefficients
are normally plotted to form the autocorrelation function or ACF. The plot is also known as a correlogram.

ACF= AUTOCORRELATION FUNCTION & PACF= PARTIAL AUTOCORRELATION FUNCTION.

WHAT IS WHITE NOISE?
Time series that show no autocorrelation are called "white noise". For white noise series, we expect each autocorrelation to
be close to zero or within the lag bounds. Of course, they are not exactly equal to zero as there is some random variation.

SIMPLE FORECASTING METHODS
A) Average Method:- Here, the forecasts of all future values are equal to the mean of the historical data.
    R Code:-  -> meanf(y, h)  #Where y contains time series & h is forecasted time perid. h=11 means forecast for next 11 years
B) Naive Method:- All forecasts are simply set to be the value of the last observation. That is, the forecasts
    of all future values are set to be yT, where yT is the last observed value. Rcode:- -> naive(y,h)
C) Seasonal Naive Methods:- A similar method is useful for highly seasonal data. In this case, we set each forecast to be
    equal to the last observed value from the same season of the year (e.g., the same month of the previous year). -> snaive(y,h)
D) Drift Method:- A variation on the naïve method is to allow the forecasts to increase or decrease over time, where the
    amount of change over time (called the drift) is set to be average change seen in the historical data.-> rwf(y, h, drift=TRUE)
    
       Exmaple:-
       library(fpp)
       beer2 <- window(ausbeer,start=1992,end=2006-.1)
       beerfit1 <- meanf(beer2, h=11)
       beerfit2 <- naive(beer2, h=11)
       beerfit3 <- snaive(beer2, h=11)
       
       plot(beerfit1, plot.conf=FALSE, 
           main="Forecasts for quarterly beer production")
           lines(beerfit2$mean,col=2)
           lines(beerfit3$mean,col=3)
           legend("topright",lty=1,col=c(4,2,3),
               legend=c("Mean method","Naive method","Seasonal naive method"))
